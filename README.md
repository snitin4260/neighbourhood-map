# About Project

In this project, I was asked to fetch locations from api / display hardcoded locations and display them on the map with animation. I also added a list view which filters the query and displays on the map

## API used

- foursquare api
- google maps api

## How to start the project

- npm install
- npm run start
- For production code, use npm run build
- See the live changes in browser window

## My Implementation

- I have used a small blue colored button to toogle the list view
- The list view has search functionality. The search filters the markers on map as well as the list view
- The list view items can be clicked to display the respective hotel location on map along with its l ocation
- CRA comes inbuilt with ServiceWorker whcih can be enabled by removing the unregister method with register method
- I have the made the app responsive and accessible
